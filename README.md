# Working Through This Project

Welcome to the meat of my personal portfolio website! I wanted to redesign my
website. Working on this, I realized I've learned a lot since about a year ago
(Aug 2023, now July 2024). I was able to complete it using my current knowledge,
without the need of YouTube tutorials, something I've struggled with a lot. This
time, I managed to do it all by reading StackOverflow threads and documentation,
especially with Next.js. It was my first time working with it, but I wanted to
try something new! I realize now that Next is not the best for single page apps.
Buuut, I do plan on adding pages for each project to go more in depth. I just
want to deploy my site to share my design, which I hope you like! :)
